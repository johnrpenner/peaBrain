peaBrain 8 Â©2024 by John Roland Penner
peaBrain is a UCI Chess Engine written in Swift for macOS
released: July 15, 2024

peaBrain 8 is the UCI version of the engine used in my commercial Chess Meister product for the iPhone. it provides a simple pedagogical chess engine written in Swift which should be easily comprehensible to anyone interested in getting started with chess programming. It can be played in any UCI compatible Chess GUI application like HIARCS. 

peaBrain uses a classic Shannon type MiniMax search with Quiescence extensions and Alpha-Beta pruning, SAN Notation, and is written to support Fischer games (coming next release), The opening book includes 10,000 moves from the ECO (Encyclopedia of Chess Openings). Runs at about 1400 ELO. Comes complete with Swift source code. 

The entire codebase is a functional port of an earlier chess engine i had written in 2010 in futureBasic called pChess 2.0 â€” which is still more advanced in its use of hash tables for greater speed, and support for fischer random chess. pChess 2.0 came with a graphical interface which allowed sound and graphic visualization of the moves in real-time as they were being processed by negamax as part of an iMac art installation. 

Usage: compile this puppy with: 

swiftc -o pea8 peaBrain8.swift -suppress-warnings

and see if you can beat the peabrain! ðŸ¤©
